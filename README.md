# Quantum Algorithms Simulation Project

⚠️ BEWARE!!! THIS IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT PHASE AND IT MIGHT NOT GIVE DESIRED OUTPUTS YET : LOW ACCURACIES
⚠️ BEWARE!!! I HAVE REMOVED SHOR'S ALGORITHM FORM THE MAIN MENU SINCE IT HAS A LOT OF ISSUES YET  - 
This project simulates Grover's, Shor's, Amplitude Amplication & QFT quantum algorithms using Qiskit in Python

## Files
- `main.py`: Entry point for running the simulations.
- `grover_algorithm.py`: Implementation of Grover's algorithm.
- `shor_algorithm.py`: Simplified version of Shor's algorithm.
- `utils/visualization.py`: Functions for visualizing results.
- `utils/helpers.py`: Placeholder for helper functions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Qiskit
- Matplotlib

## Running the Project
1. Install Qiskit and Matplotlib
2. RUN THE MAIN.PY
